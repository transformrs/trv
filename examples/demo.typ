    - Small file sizes

    - Automated video creation
    - Version control
    - Different languages/voices

    #toolbox.pdfpc.speaker-note("
      Benefits of using trv are that the files are small.
      The video that you are currently watching is less than 3 MB.
      This makes it easy to upload the video but also to self-host the video on platforms like GitHub-Pages.

      The second benefit is that the generation is fully automated.
      You just need to create a presentation and trv will take care of the rest.

      The third benefit is that you can store the source of the video in version control.
      This makes it easy to update the video or collaborate with others.

      The fourth benefit is that you can create videos in different languages and voices.
      This is useful if you are creating content for a global audience.

      You could even use it to tell jokes, because the text-to-speech engine doesn't laugh.
