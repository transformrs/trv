    As an example, we can explain the following math problem.
    ```
    )

    #v(4em)
    #align(center)[2 + 2 - 1 = x]

    What is x in this equation?
    ```
    )

    #v(4em)
    #align(center)[2 + 2 - 1 = x]

    #v(2em)
    #align(center)[What is x?]

#slide[

    ```md
    ...... To solve it, we can move the x to the left.

    Now the answer becomes clear.
    ```

    #v(4em)
    #align(center)[2 + 2 - 1 = x]
