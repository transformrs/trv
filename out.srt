As an example, we can explain the following math problem.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,680
Two plus two equals two X.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,280
What is X in this equation?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,000
To solve it, we can move the two X to the left.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,560
Or in other words, we put everything on the left side

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,240
of the equation on the right side,

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,320
and everything on the right side

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,620
of the equation on the left side.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,220
Now we move the two to the right.

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,080
This can be done by dividing both sides

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,200
of the equation by two.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,160
Now we have X is two plus two divided by two.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,800
This gives us X is four divided by two.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,120
So the answer is two.
